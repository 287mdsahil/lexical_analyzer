Some information regarding the project.

### Project Structure 

```
syntax_analyzer/
    bin/    // use this to hold the compiled .class files, but do not upload them!
    docs/   // documentation
    src/    // this will contain java sources, subfolders in here denote packages
        algorithms/
        automata/
        lexer/
        regex/
        utils/
        Main.java
```

### Package Information

1. ['algorithms'] - implementation of Thompson and Subset Construction Algorithm
2. [`automata`](docs/automata.md) - finite state machines
3. ['lexer'] - lexical analyzer
4. [`regex`](docs/regex.md) - regular expression parsing, and utilities like shunting yard algorithm and tree generation
5. ['utils'] - utility classes for support

### Compilation

Follow the above folder stucture. For compilation use `javac`. Mention the classpath (`-cp`), the destination (`-d`) and the encoding (`-encoding`).

```
syntax_analyzer>javac -cp src/ -d bin/ -encoding utf-8 src/regex/Regex.java
```

*Notes*: 

- The encoding should be `utf-8`. This is to support the epsilon (Îµ) symbol in the code.
- Wildcards (`*`, `*.java`, etc) may be used in the filenames to compile everything in one go.

### Execution

Use the `java` command. Link the compiled binaries in the classpath. Refer to classes by their fully qualified package name before the class name.

```
syntax_analyzer>java -cp bin/ regex.Regex "(a|b)*abc"
```
